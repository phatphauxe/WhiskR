================ WhiskR ================

- WhiskR is an experiment to allow the
implementation of React based widgets
into a web page.  This would allow users
with out a knowledge of the inner workings
of React to still use independent React
tools within the pages and maintain a dynamic
page without the need of reloading when tools
or widgets are used.
